## Few words about myself

My goal is to strive for professional development and growth. I am very determined and I accept criticism easily. I am able to move away from my point of view if it helps the development of a common project. I am considerate, easy to make contact, ready and want to learn something new and become better

   function squareDigits(num) {
   	return Number(
   		('' + num)
   			.split('')
   			.map(function (val) {
   				return Math.pow(val, 2);
   			})
   			.join(''),
   	);
   }
   ```
2. **C++**
